This is just for Practice Purpose, I just started learning Backend with vanilla JS (YeS YoU hEaRd It RiGhT)
I love Vanilla JS so in this project I just created a backend server for an image API which stores the data of images
URL, name, content etc of the characters from one of the most famous and my favourite anime (Shotout to One Piece).
Then I just did this that I fetched all the API data using axios in the frontend side using VANILLLLLLA (Oh gosh!) and I'm 
loving it.



IMP NOTES:

1: I used Vite to create Vanilla app, express for Backend and Vanilla for frontend.

2: My future goal is to render 3D rotating donut, ice-cream, cat, car... in both JS and C++ (because it's damm cool)

3: My aim is to become best programer and game developer with cyber Security expert skills.
